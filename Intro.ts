//type-script is a super set of js
//it is written in such a way that it is optimized version of js , so that it faces minimum error while running
//ts code is compiled in js only but while writing only we got know any errors
//javascript with precise behaviour
 //type-script is type safety
 
 //in js you can add 2+"2"(odd behaviour)
 //but in ts it will not allow

 //static checking (jav,golang already have)
 //code is being checked while writing codes in ide but not in the case of js

 //analyze the code as we type.that's it

 //Ts is development tool it is just a layer on js code


let user = {name:"yogesh"}

// console.log(user.email);
console.log(user.name);
